### Project-KapuSta-GoIT

- __My task:__
  * As a Scrum Master and tester, I participated in a QA project using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly sprint period. Our main goal was comprehensive testing of the “Kapu$ta” application, a tool for tracking monthly income and expenses divided into specific categories.
  * As part of my duties, I focused on testing the accessibility of the application, in accordance with the AA standard, ensuring comfortable use of the application for the vast majority of users. I used various tools such as Wave, DevTools, and Contrast WCAG to ensure the highest quality of accessibility tests.
  * Additionally, due to the wide spectrum of target users, we conducted functional tests, portability tests on mobile devices, and usability tests for different types of recipients.
  * Thanks to short iteration, frequent meetings, adaptability, close cooperation and continuous improvement, we were able to effectively deliver and improve the product. This experience allowed me to develop project management skills and gain valuable experience in software testing.
 
- __Soft skills in my teamwork:__
  * As a Scrum Master, I was responsible for various tasks. I conduct Stand Up meetings every day via Google Meet to plan and report on the team's work. Communication was a key part of my role and I used Slack frequently to keep in touch with team members. When planning my time, I also had to take into account the shift pattern of the testing team.
  * Another important aspect of my role was recognizing the potential of team members. I consulted with the Team Leader on the assignment of team member responsibilities that would correspond to the tester's innate abilities. When problems arose during conversations with members of the testing team, I quickly identified them and looked for solutions.
  * To facilitate communication within the team, I created a Trello board. This tool turned out to be invaluable in monitoring the testers' work progress and completion time, especially in the context of meeting the deadline. I prepared a summary of the sprint.
  * An important part of my role was close cooperation with the Team Leader. In his absence, I worked with the acting Team Leader. Our communication was primarily via Slack, both in writing and by phone.
  * Throughout my roles, I have demonstrated a number of soft skills. I showed empathy by understanding and sharing others' feelings. Precision and attention to detail were key to ensuring accuracy in each task. I was able to work effectively both individually and in a team.
My communication skills have played a key role in expressing ideas and information clearly and effectively. I have also demonstrated conflict management skills by constructively resolving disputes and disagreements.
  * Critical and creative thinking skills were essential in using logic and reasoning to determine the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to problems. I also demonstrated decision-making skills by choosing the best course of action among several options.
  * Another key skill was problem solving. Identified issues and reviewed related information to develop and evaluate options and implement solutions. Effective listening skills were crucial in fully focusing on what others were saying, taking time to understand what was being said, asking appropriate questions and not interrupting at inappropriate moments.
  * Organizational skills were crucial in planning, prioritizing and achieving goals to maximize productivity. Strong analytical thinking skills were essential in using logic and reasoning to determine the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to problems. Finally, time management skills were crucial in successfully managing one's own time and the time of others.
