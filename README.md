### Project-KapuSta-GoIT

- __My task:__
  * As a Scrum Master and tester, I participated in a QA project using agile SCRUM methodology with a weekly sprint period. Our main goal was comprehensive testing of the “Kapu$ta” application, a tool for tracking monthly income and expenses divided into specific categories.
  * As part of my duties, I focused on testing the accessibility of the application, in accordance with the AA standard, ensuring comfortable use of the application for the vast majority of users. I used various tools such as Wave, DevTools, and Contrast WCAG to ensure the highest quality of accessibility tests.
  * Additionally, due to the wide spectrum of target users, we conducted functional tests, portability tests on mobile devices, and usability tests for different types of recipients.
  * Thanks to short iteration, frequent meetings, adaptability, close cooperation and continuous improvement, we were able to effectively deliver and improve the product. This experience allowed me to develop project management skills and gain valuable experience in software testing.
 
- __Soft skills in my teamwork:__
  * As a **_Scrum Master_**, I was responsible for various tasks. I conduct Stand Up meetings every day via Google Meet to plan and report on the team's work. Communication was a key part of my role and I used Slack frequently to keep in touch with team members. When planning my time, I also had to take into account the shift pattern of the testing team.
  * Another important aspect of my role was **_recognizing the potential of team members_**. I consulted with the Team Leader on the assignment of team member responsibilities that would correspond to the tester's innate abilities. When problems arose during conversations with members of the testing team, **_I quickly identified them and looked for solutions_**.
  * To facilitate communication within the team, I created a Trello board. This tool turned out to be invaluable in monitoring the testers' work progress and completion time, especially in the context of meeting the deadline. I prepared a summary of the sprint.
  * An important part of my role was **_close cooperation with the Team Leader_**. In his absence, I worked with the acting Team Leader. Our communication was primarily via Slack, both in writing and via Call.
  * Throughout my roles, I have demonstrated a number of soft skills. I showed **_empathy_** by understanding and sharing others' feelings. **_Precision and attention to detail_** were key to ensuring accuracy in each task. I was able to **_work effectively both individually and in a team_**.
My communication skills have played a key role in **_expressing ideas and information clearly and effectively_**. I have also demonstrated **_conflict management skills_** by constructively resolving disputes and disagreements.
  * **_Critical and creative thinking skills_** were essential in using logic and reasoning to determine the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to problems. I also demonstrated **_decision-making skills_** by choosing the best course of action among several options.
  * Another key skill was **_problem solving_**. Identified issues and reviewed related information to develop and evaluate options and implement solutions. **_Effective listening skills_** were crucial in fully focusing on what others were saying, taking time to understand what was being said, asking appropriate questions and not interrupting at inappropriate moments.
  * **_Organizational skills_** were crucial in planning, **_prioritizing_** and achieving goals to maximize productivity. **_Strong analytical thinking skills_** were essential in using logic and reasoning to determine the strengths and weaknesses of alternative solutions, conclusions, or approaches to problems. Finally, **_time management skills_** were crucial in successfully managing one's own time and the time of others.
